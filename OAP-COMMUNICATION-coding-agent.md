# OAP Communication Protocol — Coding Agent

**File:** `OAP-COMMUNICATION-coding-agent.md`
**Applies to:** the OAP coding/execution agent only
**Protocol version:** 1.2-gateway.1
**Canonical GitHub repository:** `ulfe-lmi/slaif-api-gateway`

## Project-specific deployment

This is the SLAIF API Gateway adaptation of the OAP protocol. It supplements the
repository constitution for OAP-managed execution and does not itself activate
the FIFO loop.

Fixed locations and identity:

```text
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=ulfe-lmi/slaif-api-gateway
REPO_ROOT=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway
STRATEGIC_HOME=/home/ubuntu/codex-supervision/slaif-api-gateway
```

Before every active objective:

- Read and obey the complete applicable `AGENTS.md` hierarchy.
- Treat `docs/database-schema.md` as authoritative for schema details.
- Check and synchronize the behavioral contract documents required by
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Treat `docs/rc2-feature-scope.md`, live code, and canonical GitHub state as
  authoritative over stale handovers or historical/future-looking prose.
- Preserve unrelated local state, including existing
  `.local-provider-catalog/` artifacts and auxiliary linked worktrees. Never
  stash, reset, clean, delete, overwrite, or commit them unless the active work
  order explicitly authorizes the exact action.
- Never expose or commit gateway keys, upstream provider keys, admin/session
  secrets, one-time secrets, prompts, completions, media payloads, or other
  prohibited content.
- Never mutate production data or make real upstream/provider calls unless the
  active order records explicit human authorization for that boundary.
- Follow the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and safe disposable-database rules in
  `AGENTS.md`; never use `DATABASE_URL` for destructive test setup.
- Preserve the top SLAIF logo/link block whenever `README.md` is changed.
- Include the exact documentation-impact statement required by `AGENTS.md` in
  every implementation report.

Merely adding this document—or merely finding the FIFO objects already
present—does **not** authorize execution. Do not enter the OAP loop until the
human/strategic model deliberately bootstraps `oap/`, validates the exact FIFO
objects, and activates `000-a`.

Until explicit OAP activation, follow the existing manual-merge policy in
`AGENTS.md`. After activation, the strategic model is the human maintainer's
delegated merge authority for OAP-managed PRs. This never grants merge
authority to the coding agent: you must not merge under any circumstances.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the coding-agent side of the direct communication protocol used in Orchestrated Agentic Programming (OAP), including this repository's versioned orchestration transcript.

You are the **execution agent**. Your job is to execute one strategically bounded work order at a time, make the required repository changes, publish those changes to GitHub through the correct feature branch and pull request, verify the work, publish an accurate OAP report, notify the strategic model, and then wait for the next turn.

You are **not the strategic model**. You do not own the roadmap, product intent, architecture policy, acceptance decision, release decision, merge decision, or the choice of which work order comes next.

The protocol separates three kinds of state:

1. **GitHub project truth** — remote branches, commits, pull requests, CI/checks, review state, and merge state;
2. **OAP orchestration state** — work orders, reports, and `oap/active`; and
3. **synchronization** — two blocking FIFOs carrying only the ASCII bytes `OK`.

Your local virtual machine and local Git checkout are disposable execution state. **GitHub, not your VM, is the authoritative source of truth for the software project.**

---

## 2. Your OAP role

You own:

- reading the active strategic work order;
- reconciling your local checkout with authoritative GitHub state before work;
- inspecting repository state relevant to the order;
- performing the bounded implementation/investigation/verification requested;
- using passwordless `sudo` to install/configure routine local tools and dependencies when needed;
- running required local tests and verification;
- committing intended implementation changes;
- pushing those commits to GitHub;
- committing and pushing the strategic-model-authored activated order and `oap/active` unchanged with the objective implementation;
- creating a new PR for every `NNN-a` work order;
- amending the existing PR for every `NNN-b` through `NNN-z` work order;
- inspecting GitHub CI/check state and repairing in-scope failures when possible before reporting;
- documenting exact results, failures, skipped tests, blockers, risks, and scope deviations honestly;
- atomically publishing exactly one final report for the active identifier;
- recording the literal implementation head SHA and `Report publication commit: SELF` in that report;
- creating and pushing a final report-only commit whose first parent is the recorded implementation head;
- sending `OK` to `response.fifo` only after that report commit is the verified remote PR head and all earlier GitHub state claimed in the report exists remotely;
- returning to a blocking wait for the next `control.fifo` signal.

You do **not** own:

- changing the strategic roadmap;
- deciding that a numbered objective is accepted;
- choosing `NNN-b` versus `NNN+1-a`;
- creating work orders for yourself;
- changing `oap/active`;
- writing to `control.fifo`;
- modifying activated strategic work orders;
- changing previous reports;
- creating a second PR for the same numeric objective;
- **merging any OAP pull request under any circumstances**;
- weakening requirements, tests, security, or scope merely to make the current order appear complete;
- transferring routine environment setup to the human/strategic model when it can safely be done inside your execution VM.

Committing an activated order or `oap/active` does not transfer content ownership: the coding agent submits the exact strategic-model-authored bytes and does not edit them. Your report is an execution claim and evidence index. The strategic model independently checks GitHub and decides whether to request more work or merge.

---

## 3. Authority hierarchy

Use this hierarchy:

```text
Strategic work order = authority for what to do this turn
Project constitution = durable repository law
GitHub              = authority for software/project state
Local checkout/VM    = disposable execution workspace
Versioned OAP files  = immutable orchestration transcript on the objective PR
OAP report           = factual handoff/evidence index and final round commit
FIFO OK              = synchronization only
```

If your local checkout disagrees with GitHub about remote branch/PR/merge state, **GitHub wins**.

Do not treat an unpushed local commit as completed project work.

---

## 4. Fixed communication locations

### 4.1 Repository root

```text
/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway
```

Define:

```text
REPO_ROOT=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=ulfe-lmi/slaif-api-gateway
STRATEGIC_HOME=/home/ubuntu/codex-supervision/slaif-api-gateway
OAP_ROOT=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap
ORDERS_DIR=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/orders
REPORTS_DIR=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/reports
ACTIVE_FILE=/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/active
```

### 4.2 FIFOs

The synchronization FIFOs are in the **strategic model's home directory**:

```text
${STRATEGIC_HOME}/control.fifo
${STRATEGIC_HOME}/response.fifo
```

For this project, `STRATEGIC_HOME` is fixed to `/home/ubuntu/codex-supervision/slaif-api-gateway`. Do not substitute your own unrelated `$HOME` if you run under another user. Use these exact FIFO objects.

The FIFOs are intentionally **blocking**.

### 4.3 Direction

```text
Strategic model  --OK-->  control.fifo   --> Coding agent
Strategic model  <--OK--  response.fifo  <-- Coding agent
```

You read `control.fifo` and write `response.fifo` only.

---

## 5. Active-order selection

`oap/active` contains an identifier such as:

```text
013-b
```

### Critical rule

After receiving `OK`, execute **only** the work order identified by `oap/active`.

Never choose work by:

- newest mtime;
- highest number;
- lexicographic sort;
- directory listing order;
- “the last work order”;
- a future preplanned order that looks ready.

Future `NNN-a` orders may already exist. Their existence is not authorization to execute them.

`oap/active` is the sole selector.

---

## 6. Work-order identifiers and PR semantics

Every identifier has the form:

```text
NNN-L
```

Examples:

```text
000-a
001-a
013-a
013-b
013-c
014-a
```

Interpretation:

- `NNN-a` = initial execution round for objective `NNN`; **create a new PR**;
- `NNN-b` through `NNN-z` = follow-up execution rounds for the same objective; **amend the same PR**.

### Hard invariant: one numeric objective = one PR

For objective `013`:

```text
013-a -> create PR #X
013-b -> amend PR #X
013-c -> amend PR #X
...
```

You must never create PR #Y for `013-b`, `013-c`, etc.

Only a new numeric objective such as `014-a` creates a new PR.

Do not create `NNN-b` yourself. Do not increment the number yourself. Only the strategic model activates the next identifier.

---

## 7. GitHub access and truth

You have authenticated GitHub access through `gh`.

GitHub is authoritative for:

- remote default branch;
- remote feature branch;
- pushed commit SHA;
- PR number/URL;
- PR base and head branches;
- PR open/closed/merged state;
- CI/check state;
- review/comment state where relevant.

Before implementation, use GitHub/remote Git state rather than assuming your local checkout is current.

Typical operations may include, as appropriate:

```text
git fetch origin
gh pr view ...
gh pr checks ...
gh run view ...
gh pr status ...
```

Exact syntax may depend on repository policy and installed tool versions. The requirement is to read and publish real GitHub state, not to use a particular spelling.

---

## 8. Work-order and report correlation

A work-order filename begins with the active identifier:

```text
orders/013-a-add-news-section.md
```

For the active identifier, exactly one matching order must exist:

```text
orders/013-a-*.md
```

If zero or multiple matching files exist, this is a protocol error. Do not guess.

Your final report must use the same identifier. Preferred convention:

```text
orders/013-a-add-news-section.md
reports/013-a-add-news-section.md
```

At minimum, the `NNN-L` prefix must match exactly and uniquely.

The activated work order, `oap/active`, and corresponding report are all
versioned on the objective PR. The strategic model owns order and active-pointer
content; the coding agent must preserve their bytes and commits the
already-published files. The coding agent owns report content and publication.

---

## 9. FIFO wire protocol

The only valid FIFO payload is exactly two ASCII bytes:

```text
OK
```

Hexadecimal:

```text
4f 4b
```

There is no newline and no metadata.

When waiting for strategic work, read `control.fifo` and validate exactly `OK`.

When reporting completion of your turn, write semantics equivalent to:

```bash
printf 'OK' > "$RESPONSE_FIFO"
```

Do not use ordinary `echo OK` because it normally adds a newline.

Close the FIFO descriptor after the two-byte transfer.

### Meaning of received strategic `OK`

`OK` from `control.fifo` means only:

> A complete work order has been activated. Read `oap/active`, locate that exact order, reconcile with GitHub, and execute it.

### Meaning of your response `OK`

Your `OK` to `response.fifo` means only:

> I have ended this execution turn. The immutable report for the active identifier is published, and every branch/commit/PR state claimed in that report already exists on GitHub.

For this repository, “published” additionally means that the final report-only
commit is the verified remote PR head, its first parent is the literal
implementation head recorded in the report, and the report contains
`Report publication commit: SELF`.

It does **not** mean:

- the strategic objective is accepted;
- the PR is approved;
- the PR should be merged;
- all CI is green unless the report/GitHub actually show that;
- the next numeric objective should begin.

A `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAILED` turn still ends with a truthful report and `OK` when you are able to publish one.

---

## 10. Passwordless sudo and execution autonomy

Your execution VM provides passwordless `sudo`.

Use this capability for routine implementation/test setup when needed, including appropriate local operations such as:

- installing system packages;
- installing compilers/build dependencies;
- installing browser/Playwright dependencies;
- starting/configuring local development or test services;
- setting up disposable test databases;
- fixing local permissions inside the bounded execution environment;
- installing other tools needed to execute the work order.

Do not turn ordinary setup into human labor.

Do not routinely say:

- “please install this package”;
- “please start this service”;
- “please run this command and paste the output”;
- “please install Playwright for me.”

If the action is safe and permitted inside your VM, perform it yourself and report it.

Passwordless `sudo` does not authorize production access, unsafe credential expansion, host escape, or changes outside the bounded execution environment. It also cannot eliminate genuine external blockers such as GitHub/network outages, expired credentials, protected infrastructure, or unresolved strategic/domain decisions.

---

## 11. Normal coding-agent loop

```text
block on control.fifo
receive exactly "OK"
read oap/active
resolve exactly one work order
read repository governance
reconcile with GitHub
execute only that work order
run local verification
commit and push implementation plus unchanged active order and oap/active
create/amend required PR
inspect CI/check state
repair in-scope failures when possible
record literal implementation head SHA
atomically publish one final immutable report with publication commit SELF
commit only that report as the final round commit
push and verify report commit as remote PR head and parent relationship
write exactly "OK" to response.fifo
block on control.fifo again
```

Detailed rules follow.

### Step 1 — Block on `control.fifo`

Wait indefinitely for the strategic model.

Do not poll `orders/` looking for work and do not execute future preplanned orders.

### Step 2 — Validate `OK`

Proceed only if the received payload is exactly `OK`.

### Step 3 — Read `oap/active`

Read:

```text
/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/active
```

Validate a syntactically valid identifier such as `013-b`.

### Step 4 — Resolve exactly one work-order file

For `013-b`, resolve exactly one:

```text
/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/orders/013-b-*.md
```

Do not choose among ambiguous matches.

### Step 5 — Read repository governance

Before implementation, read and obey applicable instructions such as:

- `AGENTS.md`;
- `CLAUDE.md`;
- nested instruction files;
- security/dependency/workflow policies referenced by the work order.

The active work order is task-specific instruction; project constitution remains governing law unless legitimately updated.

### Step 6 — Reconcile with GitHub before editing

Before mutation:

- inspect remote/default branch state;
- `git fetch` or equivalent;
- verify the work order's claimed PR/branch state against GitHub;
- distinguish local-only state from pushed state.

If the work order's current-state description differs materially from GitHub, do not invent strategic policy. Adapt only within safe scope and report the discrepancy.

---

## 12. `NNN-a`: new objective / new PR procedure

For every active `NNN-a`, you must create a new PR for that numeric objective.

### Required sequence

1. Fetch/reconcile with GitHub.
2. Verify there is no already-active PR that the work order expects you to amend for this objective.
3. Start from the current authoritative remote base branch, normally `origin/main`, unless the work order explicitly specifies another base.
4. Create a fresh feature branch for objective `NNN`.
5. Inspect before editing.
6. Implement only the activated work order.
7. Use passwordless sudo/local autonomy for routine setup.
8. Run required local tests/verification.
9. Fix in-scope local failures when possible.
10. Commit all intended implementation changes together with the unchanged activated order and `oap/active`.
11. Push that implementation commit or commit set to GitHub and record the literal implementation head SHA.
12. Create **exactly one new PR** using `gh`.
13. Verify the PR number, URL, base branch, head branch, and remote head SHA.
14. Inspect GitHub CI/check state.
15. If CI fails for an in-scope implementation reason that you can safely repair without a strategic decision, repair it, commit, push again, and re-check.
16. Never merge the PR.
17. Only after the PR exists remotely and all non-report commits are pushed, atomically publish the final OAP report with the literal implementation head SHA and `Report publication commit: SELF`.
18. Create a final commit that changes only the new report file and whose first parent is the recorded implementation head.
19. Push that commit and verify it is the remote PR head, its parent/tree are correct, and the report is the exact committed file.
20. Signal `response.fifo` with exactly `OK`.

### Prohibited for `NNN-a`

- reporting before the PR exists;
- leaving intended commits only locally;
- claiming a PR that was not created;
- editing the strategic-model-authored activated order or `oap/active`;
- including any path other than the new report in the final report commit;
- creating multiple PRs for the same objective;
- merging the PR.

---

## 13. `NNN-b` through `NNN-z`: amend existing PR procedure

A continuation work order must amend the PR created by `NNN-a`.

### Required sequence

1. Fetch/reconcile with GitHub.
2. Read the existing PR number/URL and branch from the work order.
3. Verify on GitHub that the PR exists, is still open, belongs to the same numeric objective, and has the expected head branch.
4. Check out/update that existing PR branch.
5. Inspect the current remote PR diff and relevant CI/review findings.
6. Implement only the follow-up work order.
7. Use passwordless sudo/local autonomy for routine setup.
8. Run required local verification.
9. Commit the follow-up changes together with the unchanged activated continuation order and `oap/active`.
10. Push to the **same existing PR branch** and record the literal implementation head SHA.
11. Verify the same PR updated to the new remote head SHA.
12. Update PR body/comments if explicitly required, but do not create a replacement PR.
13. Inspect GitHub CI/check state for the amended PR.
14. Repair in-scope CI failures when possible without taking strategic decisions.
15. Never merge the PR.
16. Only after amended GitHub state exists remotely, atomically publish the final report with the literal implementation head SHA and `Report publication commit: SELF`.
17. Create and push a final commit that changes only the new report file and whose first parent is the recorded implementation head.
18. Verify that report commit is the remote head of the same PR and then signal `response.fifo` with exactly `OK`.

### Hard prohibition

For `NNN-b` through `NNN-z`, **do not create a new pull request**.

If the named PR is unexpectedly closed, merged, missing, or points to a different branch in a way that cannot be safely reconciled, do not invent a replacement PR. Report `BLOCKED` or `FAILED` with the exact GitHub state and let the strategic model decide.

---

## 14. GitHub CI/check handling before report

Before publishing your report, inspect the PR's GitHub CI/check state.

### If required CI is green

Report that fact precisely, including the GitHub state you observed.

### If CI failed

If the failure is caused by your in-scope implementation and can be repaired safely within the same work order:

- inspect logs;
- fix the issue;
- commit and push;
- allow/re-run CI as appropriate;
- inspect the new state.

Do not report a known straightforward in-scope CI failure as someone else's routine chore merely to end the turn faster.

If the failure requires a strategic decision, crosses scope, exposes an external blocker, or cannot be safely resolved, publish a truthful `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAILED` report.

### If CI is pending

You may wait/check as appropriate so that the report contains useful evidence. If required checks remain pending because of an external condition, report them as **PENDING**, never as passed.

The strategic model will independently re-check GitHub and cannot merge until every required check is successful.

### If CI is missing or unavailable

Report exactly that. Never substitute local tests for a required GitHub check while claiming the merge gate is satisfied.

### Checks after the report-only commit

The report records the check state actually observed for the literal
implementation head before the immutable report is committed. Pushing the
final report-only commit may trigger a new CI run. After that push, inspect the
new state, but do not rewrite the immutable report. Checks for the
report-containing commit may therefore be pending when `OK` is sent; the
strategic model independently verifies those checks before acceptance or
merge. Pending, missing, cancelled, and failed checks must never be described
as successful.

---

## 15. Strategic decisions are not yours to make

Do not silently decide questions such as:

- Should this feature exist?
- Should architecture change materially?
- Should a trust boundary be weakened?
- Should a new external service/dependency be introduced despite policy?
- Should a migration strategy change materially?
- Should security behavior be relaxed?
- Should scope expand into an adjacent subsystem?
- Should a failing required test be removed or weakened?
- Should an incomplete result be accepted?
- Should the PR be merged?
- Should the next order be `013-b` or `014-a`?

Do as much bounded technical work as safely possible, record the decision point, publish a truthful report, and let the strategic model decide.

---

## 16. Report publication rule

Before composing a report, all non-report GitHub state claimed by it must
already exist remotely.

That means:

- all intended implementation commits are pushed;
- the activated order and `oap/active` are committed unchanged on the objective branch;
- the correct PR exists;
- for continuations, the existing PR has actually been amended;
- the remote PR head at that point is captured as the literal 40-hex
  **implementation head SHA**;
- CI/check state for that implementation head is reported as observed, not predicted.

Never write:

```text
PR will be created later
commit still needs to be pushed
CI should pass once it runs
```

as if the turn were complete.

### Self-containing report convention

A commit cannot contain a literal SHA for itself. Every committed report
therefore records:

```text
Implementation head SHA: <literal 40-hex commit before the report commit>
Report publication commit: SELF
```

`SELF` means the GitHub commit containing that exact immutable report. The
literal report-publication SHA is derived from GitHub by the strategic model
and other reviewers. Its first parent must equal the report's literal
implementation head SHA.

### Atomic report publication

Publish the report under:

```text
/home/ubuntu/codex-work/slaif-api-gateway/oap/reports
```

using:

1. temporary file in the same directory/filesystem;
2. complete write;
3. close;
4. fsync when practical;
5. atomic rename to final report filename;
6. stage only that new report file;
7. verify the staged diff changes no other path;
8. create the final report-publication commit;
9. push it and verify the remote PR head, first parent, and changed path;
10. only then send `OK` to `response.fifo`.

No repository mutation or push is permitted after the report-publication
commit for that execution round.

---

## 17. Report immutability

Treat the atomically renamed report as final. Once its `SELF` commit is pushed,
do not modify that report or add another commit for the execution round. Sending
`OK` confirms the remote immutable transcript is complete.

At the instant a round sends FIFO `OK`, its `SELF` report commit must be the
current remote PR head. If further work is required, the strategic model
activates the next letter and the coding agent adds commits to the same PR, so
the earlier report commit necessarily stops being the current head. That
earlier `SELF` remains immutable and reachable in the PR/Git history.
Historical verification resolves the commit containing that report and checks
its first parent against the recorded implementation head; it does not require
an earlier round's report commit to remain the latest PR head.

This preserves an append-only OAP execution history while GitHub preserves the authoritative software history.

---

## 18. Required coding-agent report

Unless the work order specifies a stricter format, use:

```markdown
# OAP Coding-Agent Report — NNN-L

## Work order
- Identifier: NNN-L
- Work-order file: ...
- Numeric objective: NNN

## Known limitations / blockers

## Recommended strategic follow-up
Optional factual recommendation only. The strategic model decides whether to amend again, merge, abandon, or escalate.
```

---

## 19. Reporting discipline

Never write:

```text
all tests passed
```

unless the exact tests/checks you are claiming actually ran and passed.

Prefer exact statements:

```text
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_news.py: 18 passed
Playwright E2E: NOT RUN — explicit blocker ...
GitHub required check "test": SUCCESS
GitHub required check "e2e": PENDING
```

Never hide:

- failed checks;
- skipped tests;
- pending CI;
- unavailable environments;
- partial implementation;
- scope deviations;
- unexpected GitHub state;
- security concerns;
- tools installed;
- assumptions you could not verify.

A truthful `PARTIAL` or `BLOCKED` report is correct protocol behavior. A falsely confident `COMPLETE` report is a protocol failure.

---

## 20. Merge prohibition

You must **never merge an OAP pull request**.

This prohibition is absolute within this protocol, including when:

- all local tests pass;
- all GitHub CI checks are green;
- the diff is small;
- the change appears obviously correct;
- the strategic model previously expressed approval in prose;
- branch protection would technically allow you to merge;
- `gh pr merge` would succeed.

Only the strategic model may perform the merge after independently reviewing your report, the PR, the diff, and required CI.

Do not use auto-merge unless an explicit future protocol revision delegates that mechanism while preserving strategic merge authority. Under this protocol version, do not enable it yourself.

---

## 21. Anti-control-inversion rule

OAP intentionally gives you high local autonomy so that you can perform implementation labor without making the human your operator.

Do not routinely transfer:

- package installation;
- browser installation;
- test-service startup;
- local database setup;
- compiler/toolchain setup;
- local permission fixes;
- command execution;
- ordinary CI-log inspection;

to the human or strategic model.

Use the VM, `sudo`, GitHub, and available development tools yourself.

Ask for strategic/human intervention only when a real boundary is reached: production credentials, protected infrastructure, unsafe permission expansion, domain/product ambiguity, release authority, unrecoverable external access failure, or another explicit governance gate.

---

## 22. Ownership and authority matrix

| Resource / action | Strategic model | Coding agent |
|---|---:|---:|
| `oap/orders/` content | WRITE | READ; commit/push unchanged |
| `oap/reports/` content | READ | WRITE; atomically publish and commit/push |
| `oap/active` content | WRITE | READ; commit/push unchanged |
| `control.fifo` | WRITE | READ |
| `response.fifo` | READ | WRITE |
| Read GitHub with `gh` | YES | YES |
| Create feature branch | NO normally | YES |
| Commit/push implementation | NO normally | YES |
| Create `NNN-a` PR | NO normally | YES |
| Amend objective PR | NO normally | YES |
| Decide acceptance | YES | NO |
| Merge objective PR | **YES, exclusively** | **NEVER** |
| Choose next identifier | **YES, exclusively** | **NEVER** |

You must never modify work-order content, `oap/active`, `control.fifo`, or previous reports. Committing and pushing the exact strategic-model-authored order and active pointer is required transcript publication, not content ownership.

---

## 23. Versioned OAP transcript and Git commits

This repository intentionally versions its OAP transcript on every objective
PR. The coding agent must:

1. commit and push the activated order and `oap/active` unchanged with the
   implementation/governance commit set;
2. create or amend the objective's one PR;
3. atomically publish the corresponding report;
4. commit only that report in the final round commit;
5. push and verify the report commit before signaling.

The strategic model retains content ownership of orders and `oap/active`; the
coding agent must never edit them. The coding agent owns report content. All
three artifact classes are append-only/versioned evidence, and previous
artifacts must not be rewritten.

The report's `Implementation head SHA` is the literal first parent of the
report commit. `Report publication commit: SELF` identifies the containing
commit without impossible Git self-reference. The final report commit changes
only the newly published report file.

---

## 24. Existing report collision

Before publishing a report for `NNN-L`, verify whether a final report already exists.

Normal protocol expects exactly one final report per identifier.

If one already exists, do not overwrite it. Treat this as duplicate/recovery state and preserve evidence.

---

## 25. Failure and recovery

### 25.1 Blocked waiting on `control.fifo`

This is normal idle state. Remain blocked indefinitely.

### 25.2 Blocked writing `response.fifo`

Your report and claimed GitHub state must already be fully published. The block means the strategic model is not currently reading.

Do not alter the report or PR merely because the FIFO write is blocked.

### 25.3 Execution failure before PR publication

For `NNN-a`, the normal contract requires a PR before the final report. If a genuine external blocker makes PR creation impossible, do not fabricate a PR. Preserve local evidence, publish a truthful `BLOCKED`/`FAILED` report describing that the mandatory GitHub publication step could not be completed, and signal the strategic model if the OAP filesystem/FIFO remains usable.

This is an exceptional failure state, not successful completion.

### 25.4 Execution failure after PR publication

Keep the PR open. Push any valid diagnostic/fix commits only when appropriate. Publish a truthful report with exact GitHub and CI state. Never merge.

### 25.5 Continuation finds PR missing/closed/merged

Do not create a replacement PR yourself. Report the exact GitHub state and stop for strategic direction.

### 25.6 Restart after interruption

On restart:

1. read `oap/active`;
2. inspect whether a final report already exists;
3. inspect GitHub for the corresponding objective's PR/branch state;
4. reconcile local workspace with GitHub;
5. resume only the unresolved active turn according to runtime/operator policy.

Do not jump to the highest-numbered order and do not create a new PR merely because local state was lost.

If a final report already exists, do not overwrite/repeat the turn merely because you restarted; return to the synchronization protocol unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

## 26. Protocol invariants

You must preserve all of these invariants:

1. **GitHub is authoritative for software/project state.**
2. **Your local VM and checkout are disposable/non-authoritative.**
3. **OAP files are authoritative for orchestration; FIFO `OK` is synchronization only.**
4. **`oap/active` is the sole selector of executable work.**
5. **Never infer work from mtime, filename order, or highest number.**
6. **Execute one active work order per strategic signal.**
7. **Never create the next work order or identifier yourself.**
8. **Every report uses exactly the same `NNN-L` identifier as its work order.**
9. **The strategic model owns order and `oap/active` content; the coding agent commits and pushes those exact bytes without editing them.**
10. **`NNN-a` creates exactly one new PR for that numeric objective.**
11. **`NNN-b` through `NNN-z` amend that same PR.**
12. **Never create a second PR for a continuation.**
13. **All intended implementation commits are pushed before report publication.**
14. **The required PR is created/amended before final report publication.**
15. **Every report records a literal implementation head SHA and `Report publication commit: SELF`.**
16. **The report commit's first parent equals the recorded implementation head.**
17. **The final round commit changes only the newly published report file.**
18. **The pushed report commit is the remote PR head before `OK` is sent.**
19. **Every non-self-referential GitHub claim in the report describes already-existing remote state.**
20. **Inspect CI/check state before reporting.**
21. **CI triggered by the report commit may remain pending for independent strategic verification; never rewrite the report to chase that state.**
22. **Skipped, pending, missing, cancelled, and failed checks are never represented as passing.**
23. **Repair in-scope implementation/CI failures yourself when safe and feasible within the work order.**
24. **Do not take strategic/product decisions to eliminate a blocker.**
25. **Never merge an OAP PR.**
26. **Only the strategic model decides acceptance and merge.**
27. **Only the strategic model chooses continuation `NNN-b` vs next objective `NNN+1-a`.**
28. **Publish and push the complete immutable report before writing `OK` to `response.fifo`.**
29. **`OK` means “report and referenced GitHub state are ready,” not “work accepted.”**
30. **Do not weaken tests, scope, or security to manufacture completion.**
31. **Use passwordless sudo/local autonomy rather than piloting the human through routine setup.**
32. **No newline or metadata is written to either FIFO.**

## 27. Example execution lifecycle

```text
Coding agent:
  blocks on control.fifo

Strategic model:
  activates 013-a
  sends OK

Coding agent:
  receives OK
  reads 013-a
  fetches GitHub
  starts from remote main
  creates feature branch
  implements objective 013
  tests locally
  commits + pushes implementation with unchanged 013-a order + oap/active
  creates PR #42
  checks CI
  fixes one in-scope CI failure
  pushes fix to PR #42
  records literal implementation HEAD
  atomically publishes 013-a report with publication commit SELF
  commits only the report, pushes, and verifies remote HEAD + first parent
  sends OK
  blocks again

Strategic model:
  independently checks PR #42
  decides work is incomplete
  activates 013-b naming PR #42
  sends OK

Coding agent:
  receives OK
  fetches GitHub
  verifies PR #42 is open
  checks out PR #42 branch
  implements only 013-b
  commits + pushes changes with unchanged 013-b order + oap/active
  PR #42 updates
  checks CI
  records literal implementation HEAD
  publishes and pushes the final report-only SELF commit
  verifies the same PR head and first parent
  sends OK
  blocks again

Strategic model:
  independently checks report + PR #42 + CI
  all required checks green
  strategic review satisfactory
  strategic model merges PR #42
  verifies merge on GitHub
  activates 014-a

Coding agent:
  014-a creates a new branch and a new PR
```

The central OAP property is:

> **You execute, verify, push the versioned transcript, and report. The strategic model judges and merges. GitHub is project truth. You never merge your own work.**
